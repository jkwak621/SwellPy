""" 
This class defines features that are applicable to both Monodisperse
and Bidisperse systems. It is not intended to be insantiated, but 
can be. It is meant as a building block for other types of particle
systems. Since this class consideres the size of particles to be 
undefined, this system cannot be trained, tagged or repelled. It
can set centers and wrap particles that are outside of the box. 
These operations are all independent of particle
size/shape. 
Note there are some ``private'' methods that are implemented in this
class that are used by child classes, but not by this class. 
Calling these methods from the ParticleSuspension class will not be
successful. 
``Save'' and ``Load'' functionality is also defined in this file
and is NOT a method of the ParticleSystem class.
